# Creating a mod

## Select a repository

The first step will be to select a repository to host your mod's metadata.

### Own metadata repository

When you log into github with EASI, a repository named `EASIMETA` will be created. By default, EASI will send all your mods' metadata to this repository, because it's yours.

The catch is that in order for your mods to be made available for download, end-users will need to `add` your repository to their list of repositories.

This is fine if, for example, you are the maintainer of all the skins for your organization.

This is less fine if you're not part of any organization and are releasing a HUD mod for the A-10C, in which case you would probably prefer to use the `root metadata repository`.

### EASI root metadata repository

The `root metadata repository` is the central repository of EASI, the only one that is visible by all the clients out of the box.

It's located at [https://github.com/EASIMETA/EASIMETA][https://github.com/EASIMETA/EASIMETA].

This time, the catch is that you cannot write in a repository you do not own.

What you can do, however, is make a copy of the repository, change it, and then send your changes to the owner with a message attached to it, describing your changes.

This process is called a `Pull Request`, and EASI will do it automatically for you.

The disadvantage of the `Pull Request` method is that it may take some time between the moment you make your changes, and the mooment the owner of the repository accepts and merge them, so your mod will not be available immediatly.

### Directories

#### The cache

The cache is where EASI stores every local file it works with, be it texture files from mods you've downloaded or meta-data related to available mods.

By default, i'ts located in a `./cache` folder in the same directory EASI's installed in.

As it can grow quite large, you can move the cache to another location via the `Settings` menu.

##### `meta` folder

The `meta` folder contains the `metadata` of all mods.

Metadata
:   Merriam-Webster defines the term "metadata" as "data that provides information about other data"[^1]. In the context of EASI, the primary "data" would be the mod itself: the textures, the *.lua files, the readme, etc. The "metadata" would be the file that contains the mod name, the list of files to download, and where to install them.

All `metadata` files are stored in a [Git][git] repository.

During normal use, you don't need to worry about it at all (except for accepting or rejecting changes to your mods).

However, nothing prevents you from [managing your repositories yourself](#managing-your-repositories).

The `metadata` inside the `meta` folder is contained within Git repositories arranged by their Github username.

#### Managing your repositories directly

##### I know Git

If you're familiar with [Git][git], this is the basic workflow:

1. Pull or fork the `metarepo` you want to edit
2. Make your changes
3. Commit and push / make a PR
4. Profit!

##### What's Git ?

If you're not familiar with Git but would still want to give it a try, I strongly recommend you give this a go first:

###### Install Git

You will need to [download and install git][gitdl] on your machine before you can use it locally.

###### (optional) Get a GUI

Also, for the day-to-day use, you might want to use an application with a GUI instead of the crude CLI that comes with Git.

I would recommend you give [SmartGit][smartgit] or [GitKraken][gitkraken] a go, they're both free for non-commercial use.
