By default, EASI will send all your mods\u2019 metadata to this repository, because it\u2019s yours.\n\n\nThe catch is that in order for your mods to be made available for download, end-users will need to add your repository to their list of repositories, which is a manual operation.\n\n\nThis is fine if, for example, you are the maintainer of all the skins for your organization.\n\n\nThis is less fine if you\u2019re not part of any organization and are releasing a HUD mod for the A-10C, in which case you would probably prefer to use the \nroot metadata repository\n.\n\n\nEASI root metadata repository\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe \nroot metadata repository\n is the central repository of EASI, the only one that is visible by all the clients out of the box.\n\n\nIt\u2019s located at [https://github.com/EASIMETA/EASIMETA][https://github.com/EASIMETA/EASIMETA].\n\n\nThis time, the catch is that you cannot write in a repository you do not own.\n\n\nWhat you can do, however, is make a copy of the repository, change it, and then send your changes to the owner with a message attached to it, describing your changes.\n\n\nThis process is called a \nPull Request\n, and EASI will do it automatically for you.\n\n\nThe disadvantage of the \nPull Request\n method is that it may take some time between the moment you make your changes, and the mooment the owner of the repository accepts and merge them, so your mod will not be available immediatly.\n\n\nThe Pull Request\n\u00b6\n\n\nStep 2: name your mod\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe name of your mod can be any text value of your choosing, as long as it fits the following 2 rules:\n\n\n\n\nRule 1: the name of your mod must contain a string of four contiguous letters (case doesn\u2019t matter)\n\n\nRule 2: the name of your mod must be unique \nwithin the selected metadata repository\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: choose your mod\u2019s \u201ctype\u201d\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe type of your mod serves to describe its purpose to the end-user.\n\n\nIt also helps for sorting and finding mods.\n\n\nStep 4: choose the initial version number\n\u00b6\n\n\nA versionning scheme is needed to allow updates.\n\n\nIf you do not want to manage the versions yourself, it\u2019s mighty fine: leave it at the default when you create a new mod, and let EASI bump the version for you when you update your mod.\n\n\nEASI is following the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver] rules for its versionning; both for EASI itself, and for the mods.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nEASI uses \nrc\n as the default tag for the \nprerelease\n part of the SemVer; feel free to use any other one you like !\n\n\n\n\nGoing deeper\n\u00b6\n\n\nDirectories\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe cache\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe cache is where EASI stores every local file it works with, be it texture files from mods you\u2019ve downloaded or meta-data related to available mods.\n\n\nBy default, i\u2019ts located in a \n./cache\n folder in the same directory EASI\u2019s installed in.\n\n\nAs it can grow quite large, you can move the cache to another location via the \nSettings\n menu.\n\n\nmeta\n folder\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe \nmeta\n folder contains the \nmetadata\n of all mods.\n\n\n\n\nMetadata\n\n\nMerriam-Webster defines the term \u201cmetadata\u201d as \u201cdata that provides information about other data\u201d\n1\n. In the context of EASI, the primary \u201cdata\u201d would be the mod itself: the textures, the *.lua files, the readme, etc. The \u201cmetadata\u201d would be the file that contains the mod name, the list of files to download, and where to install them.\n\n\n\n\nAll \nmetadata\n files are stored in a [Git][git] repository.\n\n\nDuring normal use, you don\u2019t need to worry about it at all (except for accepting or rejecting changes to your mods).\n\n\nHowever, nothing prevents you from \nmanaging your repositories yourself\n.\n\n\nThe \nmetadata\n inside the \nmeta\n folder is contained within Git repositories arranged by their Github username.\n\n\nEASI_META\n\u00b6\n\n\nMain EASI metadata folder\n\n\nCustom \nmetarepo\n\u00b6\n\n\nManaging your repositories directly\n\u00b6\n\n\nI know Git\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with [Git][git], this is the basic workflow:\n\n\n\n\nPull or fork the \nmetarepo\n you want to edit\n\n\nMake your changes\n\n\nCommit and push / make a PR\n\n\nProfit!\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Git ?\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with Git but would still want to give it a try, I strongly recommend you give this a go first:\n\n\nhttps://try.github.io\n\n\nTutorials about Git\n\u00b6\n\n\nhttps://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial\n\n\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/\n\n\nInstall Git\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou will need to [download and install git][gitdl] on your machine before you can use it locally.\n\n\n(optional) Get a GUI\n\u00b6\n\n\nAlso, for the day-to-day use, you might want to use an application with a GUI instead of the crude CLI that comes with Git.\n\n\nI would recommend you give [SmartGit][smartgit] or [GitKraken][gitkraken] a go, they\u2019re both free for non-commercial use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metadata\n\n[git]: https://git-scm.com/\n\n[gitkraken]: https://www.gitkraken.com/\n\n[smartgit]: http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/\n\n[gitdl]: https://git-scm.com/download/win\n\n[semver]: http://semver.org/\u00a0\n\u21a9",
